## Week 1
### Stringy.java 
Both of the below functions are called and tested in the main function:
1. reverso() reverses a string
2. containsSameChars() checks whether two given strings contain the same set of characters and have the same length

### ThrowingGames.java
Both of the below functions are called in the main function. LostGameException is caught in main. By running main, you'd get thrown right into the "game"
1. LostGameException is a custom exception thrown when imaThrow() is called
2. imaThrow()'s only purpose is to throw
3. startGame() is the program that accepts numbers from the user through CLI and handles all the possible unchecked exceptions that can occur

### Hashbrown.java
Both of the below functions are called and demonstrated in the main function. Stream map() example is also accomplished within main()
1. hashMapping() creates and adds and removes elements on a HashMap<String, String>
2. linkedHashMapping() creates and adds and removes elements on a LinkedHashMap<String, String>
